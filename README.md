# neural_chess_model

Tensorflow chess model to score chess positions.

Currently this is an exploration into representations of chess positions. 

The [HalfKP](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Stockfish_NNUE) representation was so interesting I had to try a few to see what works.


Works with pgn data, such as from the [fics database](https://www.ficsgames.org/download.html).
